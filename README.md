# FFT_Trial
3-7-19: Currently I am just cleaning up some of the code in the KM class: removing redundancies, making certain things their own functions, deleting variables that were defined as empty lists then never used. I'm also starting to practice with ggplot. I haven't tried to implement it in any of these yet, but I'm confident the transistion from pyplot will not be too difficult. 

Here's where i'll be working on the class

So far the Corr, PSD, and Taylor functions are all up and running fine. They use random trajectories from the csv file to determine the functions they are plotting

The KM Class is built. I still need to go through and clean it up a little bit more. I still have not got to implementing ggplot, and the class took most of my time. 

The new file, TestClass, runs the other two classes, KM and PSD, using the input (currently hard coded) from the user. Creating custom plotter is the next step.
